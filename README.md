# Calorie Intake Recommendation and Tracking
Although food packaging comes with calorie labels, it is not very convenient for people to refer. Therefore, we propose a DEEP LEARNING based
calorie tracking model to monitor peopleâ€™s daily calorie intake. Based on an internally calculated parameter, our model also suggests
the users, appropriate food, and relevant exercises. Along with this, we have a food-label tracker as well, which will suggest the user if a particular food item is fit for consumption or not.
