# Calorie Intake Recommendation and Tracking
Although food packaging comes with calorie labels, it is not very convenient for people to refer. Therefore, we propose a DEEP LEARNING based
calorie tracking model to monitor peopleâ€™s daily calorie intake. Based on an internally calculated parameter, our model also suggests
the users, appropriate food, and relevant exercises. Along with this, we have a food-label tracker as well, which will suggest the user if a particular food item is fit for consumption or not.

### DL-1
DL-1 takes physical attributes such as Age, Gender, Height and Weight as the training features and gives user's health state as the output.
In this model, the output is coded as: 
0: Underweight,
1: Healthy,
2: Overweight,
3: Obese.
